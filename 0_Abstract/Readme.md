The purpose of the project is to design an ultrasonic pest repellent. Such a device can be
very useful to counter the various problems caused by ants, insects, pests, rodents, etc. The
device is compact, cheap, and it does not cause any pollution unlike the other chemical
repellents. We have used a microcontroller to generate sweep in sound frequencies, and an
assembly consisting of audio power amplifier, speaker and LCD for this purpose. The technical
details of this project follow later. The circuit has been experimentally tested on ants, bugs, and
small insects, and it has been successful in repelling them through the generation of ultrasonic
frequency sound.
